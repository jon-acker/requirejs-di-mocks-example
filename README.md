Example of Requirejs Dependency Injection / Mocks

An example of how requirejs can be used as a DI container in order to provide jasmine spy objects in place of the required object to the objects-under-test.

Clone the project, then:

    sudo npm install -g grunt
    npm install
  
To run the specs:

    grunt jasmine 
  
To view the specs run in the browser, load the local file: _SpecRunner.html
